## JokeBot

JokeBot is a Slack bot which upon summoning ```/joke``` tells the user a Chuck Norris joke.

This bot uses the [Chuck Norris Facts API](https://api.chucknorris.io/).

I created this bot using the following instructions, documentation and examples:
 
- [Build a Slackbot in NodeJS with Slacks Bolt API](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-a-slackbot-in-node-js-with-slacks-bolt-api/)
- [Serverless Example: Node HTTP API on AWS](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-http-api)


Since i did not opt for using a real AWS account for this course I set up a free account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for testing the lamba in serverless-offline from the Slack API.
